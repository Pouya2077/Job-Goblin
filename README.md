This project is meant for a single user, not meant for production. If someone wants to use it they can host it locally or remotely with a few minor script tweaks.

Development will be iterative with modularized stages of development. This ensures that individual components can work somewhat independently of each other so that parts of the program are usable before the entire thing is finished.
